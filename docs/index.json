[{"content":"About Me Hello, world! My name is Tanisha and I am a first year B.Tech IT student at Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women (IGDTUW).\nMy college keeps me very busy (the travel time alone is exhausting enough haha) but when I\u0026rsquo;m not focusing on academics, you\u0026rsquo;ll find me dabbling in design (check out my Behance), reading a book or making art! If I\u0026rsquo;m feeling super ambitious, you\u0026rsquo;ll catch me studying about machine learning, cryptocurrancy or cybersecurity.\nI also enjoy playing games from time to time, the cozier the better! My current favourites would be Stardew Valley, Genshin Impact and Minecraft. And when I\u0026rsquo;m tired of everything around me, my go-to escape is listening to music - especially this playlist.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve made it this far, thank you dear reader. I do hope you\u0026rsquo;ll come back for more but until then - may your bugs be few and your coffee be strong!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blog/docs/posts/first-post/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"about-me\"\u003eAbout Me\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHello, world!
