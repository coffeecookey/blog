## About Me

Hello, world! My name is Tanisha and I am a first year B.Tech IT student at Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women (IGDTUW).

My college keeps me very busy (the travel time alone is exhausting enough haha) but when I'm not focusing on academics, you'll find me _dabbling in design_ (check out my [Behance](https://www.behance.net/tanishaojha20)), _reading a book_ or _making art_!
